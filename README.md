# petals

A neat little animation based on additive shape construction.

Requires [Futhark](http://futhark-lang.org) and SDL2 and SDL2-ttf
libraries with associated header files.


## Building and running

First run `futhark pkg sync` once.

Then run `make && ./petals -R -w 600 -h 600` to build and run in a
window.
